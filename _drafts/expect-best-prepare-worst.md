# You are about to go on an adventure

Imagine you are on an outdoor adventure in a wild and rugged mountain range.  You're on the plain approaching the mountains through fog, wind and rain.  In order to climb the peak you are heading for you have to cross a wide, deep and scary chasm.

There's no way around this obstacle, the only way to get to your goal is to find a way across it. The chasm is so wide and the fog so thick that you can't actually see the other side, but you can see the mountain peak you want to scale in the distance.

As you approach the obstacle you spot a rope bridge that apparently spans the chasm.  Next to the bridge is wise guru who greets you in a friendly manner.  She asks you how she can help.  You tell her that you want to get to the other side of this chasm in order to climb the mountain.  The guru tells you that the only way across is via the somewhat rickety looking rope bridge.

"Are you sure this is the only way?" you ask.  "There may be others", she says, "but this is the way most people take".  "That bridge looks a little dangerous to me" you tell her.  "Well", she says, "it is quite a tricky bridge to cross.  In fact, 9 out of 10 people that try to cross it fall off before they reach the other side, never to be seen again. I can give you some advice on how to cross it safely but you'll have to take the journey by yourself".

You're an adventurer and you really want to climb the mountain you see in the distance.  The only way to get to it is over this bridge.  Do you cross it, knowing that only 1 in 10 people get across safely?

Welcome to the world of the innovation start up.

# What's the problem?

It is difficult to put an exact figure on start up success because it depends both on how you define a start up and how you define success.  However, [figures for the UK][startup-stats-uk] suggest that 57.6% of businesses started in 2013 were gone by 2018. In other words, fewer than half of UK start ups make it beyond 5 years.

That doesn't seem so bad, though, does it? There's still close to a 50% chance of surviving for at least 5 years, right?  Unfortunately, these figures apply to all start ups, including those that are following a well trodden path (e.g. plumbers, fitness instructors, accountants etc.). The kind of start ups Geovation works with do not fall into the category of established business types.

Instead, we work with innovative start ups. That is to say, start up businesses that are testing assumptions that haven't been tested before (i.e. sufficiently new teachnologies, product & services and/or markets) and which have potential for exponential rather than linear growth. The [figures for startups like these][innovation-startup-stats] are much less comforting: 9 out of 10 innovation start ups fail (interestingly there is much less information about when these start ups fail, but the figure of 9 out of 10 failures is commonly accepted).


# How do I cross the bridge without falling off?

So, I'm an innovation start up and I want to be in the 10% that succeed.  How do I achieve that?

Going back to our adventure metaphor, many of the 9 out of 10 that fail set off on their journey on a sunny day, full of excitement about scaling that enticing mountain. There seems to be a path to the top because they can see pictures of all the other adventurers that have made it to the peak. They're wearing shorts, T-shirt and flip-flops because it's a beautiful day and what could go wrong? They take their phone with them because they're not stupid, they want a map and a way to call home if they get into difficulty.

It's only when the weather starts to close in and the battery is running out on their phone that they start to worry. They've come this far, though, and the peak is still in the distance so they keep going. Perhaps they reach the rope bridge spanning the chasm and start to cross, only to slip and fall off half way.

To paraphrase a rather old joke: "if you want to get there I wouldn't be starting from here".  As the founder of an innovation start up you are entering a world that is practically defined by the huge amount of uncertainty it contains. Surely, then, it makes sense to be as prepared as possible.

You want to find as many maps of the area as you can, no matter that they are incomplete. It makes sense to get the right equipment so that you're prepared if you get into difficulty. You take food and water in case you have to eat on the way.  You might enlist the help of a local guide if you can find one. You check the weather reports and tell people where you're going so that you can call for help if you get stuck. And when you reach that rope bridge you rig up a safety line to help you if you slip.

# Enough of the metaphors!

The key to being a 1 in 10 lies in the definition of an innovation start up stated above. An innovation start up is *testing assumptions that haven't been tested before*. The primary reason why most innovation start ups fail is that they don't realise that everything they are doing is a question, not a statement.

The most useful thing you can do in this situation is to *make sure you fully understand the question you are asking*. There are many ways we can help you do this: **Customer Personas**, **Value Propositions**, **Unit Economics** and **Service Design Blueprints** to name but a few. Take the journey a step at a time by creating **experiments** and **prototypes**. Be prepared to change direction to find a better route if the one you are on is blocked (this is known as a **pivot**). Understand that it is your job to **learn from your customers** not to tell them what to do.

You want to scale a mountain but try a smaller peak first. Build **one thing** that your **research** has shown you that people are actually prepared to pay for before trying to build an enterprise.
