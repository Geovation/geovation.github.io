If your idea needs property or location information to make it work, you’ve come to the right place. Geovation is all about experimenting and developing your ideas. Location is everywhere, and our mission is to expand its use in the UK’s innovation community.

This blog is an unruly space where our team of software engineers can share code, educate us with their location-based projects and for all things tech related. 

Visit https://geovation.uk/programme/ to find out more about our funded accelerator programme for property and location-based startups.
