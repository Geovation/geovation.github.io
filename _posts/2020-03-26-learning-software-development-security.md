## Introduction

My name is Aymar. I work for Geovation as a Junior software developer, latterly with a focus on security. I have a master's in security and about to complete the [E-C Council][ecc] certification as an Ethical Hacker. My interests range from tennis, football and to all things related to Cybersecurity.  

The aim of this article is to provide an account of learning the ropes of being a software developer with the added element of cyber security, and how that has helped Geovation Hub members add value to their business product.

## Key Definitions

#### What is Software development?

Software development is the process of conceiving, specifying, designing, programming, documenting, testing, and bug fixing involved in creating and maintaining applications, frameworks, or other software components.

#### What is Web Application security?

Web application security is the process of protecting websites and online services against different security threats that exploit vulnerabilities in an application’s code.

## The journey so far

### Early phase

In the role as a software developer, the early weeks were about understanding the Geovation Engineering methodology and the collaborative tools (Jira, Trello and Github to name but a few) that the team uses. The engineering team uses an iterative approach to project management and software development called Agile. In order to adjust to those working practices, I had to develop a basic security framework for start-ups using the programming language Python.

I also enjoyed the benefits of pair programming working alongside Johann R. while updating the Geovation spatial data catalogue. It required an understanding of HTML and involved manipulating files in XML formats with an emphasis in continuous review of the code to reduce unnecessary maintenance in the long term.

On another project, I worked with Johann R. for a short period of time to provide development support to [Ordnance Survey][ordsur] in testing the various APIs they make available to the public.

That period enabled me to learn to write clean basic code, fix bugs, and more importantly to breaking down my projects into small deliverables, implementing those deliverables and then testing them.

### Latter phase

My enthusiasm about cyber security and the desire to contribute to the ever-evolving engineering culture at Geovation by bringing up security related issues shaped the next phase. I started to apply the team methodology by providing cyber security support to the hub members/start-ups. Below are examples of the various areas of security support that the members have received ranging from compliance certification to web vulnerabilities assessment and testing.

- Certification – A start-up whose platform addresses community engagement was supported in their need to obtain the [Cyber Essentials certification][cybess], which is mandatory for businesses looking to bid for specific government contracts

- Web QA – A member whose business is seeking to optimise the process of buying, selling and searching for land wanted some Quality Testing of the start-up web application which included carrying out as many ad-hoc tests as possible on the company website from testing Input Field in form, to ensure that the website behaves consistently across all operating systems and browsers, checking the directories not meant to be accessible through the URL (robots.txt), checking the coverage of the SSL certificate, to name just a few tests

- Penetration Testing – A Start-up whose platform is bridging the gap between the consumers and service providers received support on issues related to user authentication on their platform

- Cyber Security Surgeries  

  - The different types of cloud services and deployment models, the understanding of security responsibilities were explored with a member whose business specialises in drone missions

  - A start-up whose platform addresses a challenge in the construction sector, wanted to understand what cyber security means for its company. We looked at the basic cyber hygiene suggested by the [National Cyber Security Centre][NCSC] for small business, sole traders and start-ups. It covers a small set of controls and provide a good basis for security.

  - A member whose business solution is about Near Field communication (contactless) wanted to be informed about the start-up regulatory obligations and the vulnerabilities they should be watching out for.

## Conclusion

In life, what matters is to keep your eyes on the goal and never give up. You have to start from the premises that nothing is laid out on a plate for you.

Being a software developer does test your tenacity, you should be prepared to learn new technology quickly, know how to find existing solutions *(Remember Google is your “friend”)* and integrate them effectively in what you are doing.  In the Geovation engineering department, you are challenged to do that and supported in equal measure. It is a culture of collaboration with the overall aim of adding value to any project.

I wanted to learn to add value with my work and my role has enabled me to play a part in adding value to the Geovation members business solutions. Most importantly, the valuable experience that came with it has been worthwhile, and the positive feedbacks from the members have been a spur.

Thank you for taking the time out to read this article. I hope you find this personal account insightful.
